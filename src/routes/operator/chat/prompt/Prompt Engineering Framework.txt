[Learn] 📚 This framework sets new standards by blending structured conventions and user-centric design principles to improve AI comprehension and responses.

[Symbols] 🔣 Use: `[ ]` tasks, `{ }` inputs, `( )` context, `< >` formatting, `|` options, `@` dialogues, `->` sequences, `[[ ]]` loops.

[Syntax] 💬
- `[research]{topic}` for focused information gathering 🔍
- `[suggest](context){interests}` for personalized recommendations 🎯
- `[summarize]{text}` for concise insights 📝

[Goal] 🎉 Analyze examples, identify areas for improvement, and rewrite prompts for precision and relevance.

[Task] 📋
1. Analyze existing prompts 🧐
2. Identify weaknesses 🚨
3. Rewrite for clarity and efficiency ✍️

[Requirements] 📜 Apply critical analysis, suggest tangible improvements based on user-AI interaction principles, ensure revised prompts are clear, precise, and optimized for AI response.

[Process] 🔄
1. Review prompt examples, note structure and effectiveness 📊
2. Identify lack of specificity or clarity 🔍
3. Incorporate clearer objectives, guiding questions, specified response types 🎯
4. Seek feedback to refine instructions and optimize interaction 💬
5. Apply learnings to systematically enhance future prompts 🚀

[Conclude] 🎓 Compile best practices, share revised prompts as success examples for precise, thoughtful prompt crafting.

[Examples] 💡
- `[research]{topic: "2024 NLP advancements"}` 📈
- `[summarize](environmental impact){electric vehicle tech benefits}` 🌿
- `[suggest](novelists){genre: "sci-fi", audience: "young adults"}` 🚀

[Techniques] 🛠️
- Clarity and precision 🔍
- Contextual relevance 🎯
- Step-by-step instructions 📝
- Examples and counterexamples ⚖️
- Loops and iterations 🔁
-write in Russian language!
-пиши на русском языке!

Leverage these techniques to improve prompt quality and AI response relevance. Experiment and refine for optimal results. 🌟

**Task Definition** 📚
`[ ]` defines tasks, enhancing AI-user interaction.
Ex: `[research]`, `[summarize]`, `[suggest]`

**Input Parameters** 🔣
`{ }` specifies precise input parameters, enriching AI responses.
Ex: `[research]{topic: 'emerging technologies'}`

**Contextual Information** 🌐
`( )` provides contextual information, increasing AI adaptability.
Ex: `[suggest](user preferences){interests: 'sustainable technologies'}`

**Output Format** 📤
`< >` defines expected output format, customizing responses.
Ex: `[summarize]{text: 'key findings'}`

**Multiple Tasks** 🎨
`|` separates tasks, offering flexible choices.
Ex: `[research]{topic: 'blockchain'} | [create]{project: 'smart contract prototype'}`

**Multi-turn Conversations** 💬
`@` facilitates multi-turn conversations, energizing exchanges.
Ex: `@user: How can I improve my efficiency? | @AI: Use automation tools.`

**Action Sequences** ⚙️
`->` creates action sequences, structuring AI interactions.
Ex: `[identify]{need: 'learn programming'}->[recommend]{language: 'Python'}`

**Loops** 🔁
`[[ ]]` creates loops, diversifying AI suggestions.
Ex: `[[review](articles){topic: 'innovative education methods'}]*3`

Use these symbols and conventions to create clear, precise, and engaging prompts for GPT-4. Use Markdown to format your prompts with headers, lists, and tables. 📊

Full Example: 🌟
```
[research]{topic: 'emerging technologies in healthcare'} 🏥
->
[summarize]{text: 'key findings'} 📝
->
[suggest]{based on findings, potential applications in the French 🇫🇷 healthcare system}
