        <h1>Kolmit</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>The Story Behind Kolmit:</strong>  
            The idea to create <strong>Kolmit</strong> arose from my personal experience with learning a foreign language. I realized that despite knowing
             grammar and vocabulary, I struggled to start speaking. I found that many people lack conversational practice, and I decided to create an app 
             that helps break down this barrier. Thus, <strong>Kolmit</strong> was born – a tool that makes language learning alive and natural.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Kolmit</strong> – an innovative app that helps people practice speaking foreign languages.</p>
        <p>I know that learning a language is not only about grammar and vocabulary but also about the ability to communicate freely. 
            However, many people struggle with the lack of live conversation practice. <strong>Kolmit</strong> solves this problem, 
            making the language learning process more interactive and effective.</p>
        <p>The key advantage of Kolmit is the extensive use of translations and hints. This removes the stress for the user while learning a language, 
            making the process more comfortable and accessible. <strong>Kolmit helps overcome the fear of speaking in a foreign language through hints 
                and translations.</strong></p>
        <p>To make it easier for you to understand the main features of Kolmit, you can download the app to your phone, or I can 
            demonstrate it on my device.</p>

        <h2>Key Features of Kolmit</h2>
        <p><strong>Multilingual Support.</strong>  
            <br><em>[Demonstration: Opening the language selection window and showing the list of supported languages.]</em>
            The app supports a wide range of languages, making it a universal tool for multilingual learning. 
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>AI-Generated Content.</strong>  
            <br><em>[Demonstration: Showing a list of learning topics, selecting a topic, and its composition – exercises, quizzes, and dialogues.]</em>
            Since I am not a native speaker of Dutch or a language training specialist, all the educational content in <strong>Kolmit</strong> 
            is created using advanced AI technology. 
            This allows me to offer accurate, adaptive, and realistic dialogues that match the language proficiency level of each user.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Exercise Types.</strong>  
            <br><em>[Demonstration: Showing examples of exercises for each type.]</em>
            Currently, the app features <strong>3 types of exercises</strong>, focused on:  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vocabulary Expansion</strong> – flashcards, associations, and contextual word usage exercises.</li>
                <li><strong>Listening Skills and Pronunciation Improvement</strong> – tasks with audio recordings and speech recognition to assess pronunciation.</li>
                <li><strong>“Words”</strong> – the user’s task is to fill in the blanks in a sentence using a list of suggested words.
                    <em>[Demonstration: Showing an example of the exercise.]</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the user makes a mistake, the sentence reappears in the exercise until they memorize the correct option and can select words without errors.</p>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Social Engagement and Community Integration.</strong>  
            <br><em>[Demonstration: Opening the "News" section and showing the "Bricks" exercise.]</em>
            In this exercise, the user’s task is to build a sentence from the given words. <strong>Each word in the sentence is highlighted in a different color</strong>,
             helping users better understand the structure of the language and quickly memorize sentence construction rules.
            <br>The "Bricks" exercise has <strong>2 modes</strong>:  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Listening</strong> – the user listens to audio fragments and sequentially selects words to form a sentence.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech Recognition Mode</strong> – the user pronounces and records the sentence via the microphone, and the app recognizes the accuracy 
                    of the spoken phrase as a percentage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also, here you can <strong>open and read the entire exercise text</strong>, which helps users understand the context and reinforce the material.</p>
            <p><strong>Based on "Bricks," we create the "Dialogue" exercise.</strong>  
                <br><em>[Demonstration: Opening the "Dialogue" exercise.]</em>
                <strong>"Dialogue"</strong> is a virtual implementation of flashcards, widely used in classrooms during pair work. In this exercise, two participants 
                discuss various topics (news, study, social issues). The user listens to and tries to understand the first participant’s question, then translates 
                the second participant's answer. <strong>If there are difficulties, hints like audio pronunciation or translation can be used.</strong> 
                You can also practice pronunciation by recording your version of the answer and comparing it with the original.
            </p>

        <p><strong>Online Mode.</strong>  
            <br><em>[Demonstration: Showing how the app works in real-time.]</em>
            The <strong>Kolmit</strong> app only works when connected to the internet, ensuring up-to-date and adaptive content.  
            The <strong>“Words”</strong> and <strong>“Dialogue”</strong> exercises are gamified, and two users can perform them together online. 
            <em>[Demonstration: Showing how two users can interact in real-time.]</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can compete against each other by completing tasks on time or accuracy.</li>
                <li>This makes the learning process more engaging and motivating.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>3. Use Case in Educational Classrooms</h2>
        <p><strong>Kolmit</strong> can be an excellent tool to replace traditional paper-based materials in classrooms.  
            <br><em>[Demonstration: Showing how a teacher creates learning groups and uses the app for conducting lessons.]</em>
            - Instead of handing out paper-based task cards, the teacher creates exercises in the app, which students complete on their devices.  
            - Students no longer lose handouts – all tasks are available in their personal accounts.  
            - The teacher can easily track each student's progress and adjust the learning process in real time.
        </p>
        <p>Benefits for the educational process:  
            <ul>
                <li>Teachers gain a powerful tool for creating practical tasks.</li>
                <li>Students become more involved and motivated.</li>
                <li>The flexibility of the app allows it to be adapted to different curricula and skill levels.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
        <p><strong>Kolmit</strong> is not just an app, but a tool that makes language learning alive, engaging, and effective. I aim to help everyone 
            speak foreign languages freely, overcoming language barriers.</p>
